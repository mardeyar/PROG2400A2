# PROG2400: A2
C++ implementation of a linked list data structure with various methods for manipulation and testing.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local:

```git clone https://github.com/mardeyar/PROG2400A2.git```

## Structure
- LinkedList.h: Header file containing the class definition for the LinkedList class and the Node struct.
- LinkedList.cpp: Source file containing the implementation of the LinkedList class methods.
- Node.h: The header file containing the definition of the Node struct used in the linked list.
- main.cpp: Source file containing the main function with method calls for testing the LinkedList implementation.

## Methods
- insertStart(int data): Insert a new node at the beginning of the list.
- insertEnd(int data): Insert a new node at the end of the list.
- insertAtIndex(int data, int index): Insert a new node at a specified index in the list.
- deleteFirst(): Delete the first node in the list.
- deleteLast(): Delete the last node in the list.
- deleteAtIndex(int index): Delete the node at a specified index in the list.
- static LinkedList mergeList(LinkedList &firstList, LinkedList &secondList): Merge two lists.
- displayList(): Display the elements of the list.
- listSize(): Get the size of the list.
